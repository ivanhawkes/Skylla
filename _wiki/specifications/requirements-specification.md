# Requirements Specification

Provides a detailed list of all the elements required to create the game. This should list features that are desired, though detail on how those features work is best left to the xxx document.

# Movement System

Provides standard top down shooter controls i.e.

* left / right
* forward / backward
* keeps the ship within the play area window
* ensures ship is moved constantly forward at least within the constraints of the game play area, if not within world space

# RPG Elements

## Experience System

Provides a means of progressing the player's power.

Experience can be gained through:

* killing enemies / percentage cleared
* looting extra bonus ship wreckage

## Loot System

Are we going to have items that can be looted from the remains of ships?

## Ship Accessory System

Allow the player to upgrade their ship with a range weapons, shields, that can help to tailor the game play to their particular style.

Can we upgrade to higher spec ships as they progress? For example, the starter ship might have anchor points for one front turret which can take a small laser. Later ships might have many more anchor points and the ability to attach much heavier equipment

Consider providing some manoeuvre advantages to certain ships, or if the player takes a lighter loadout for any given ship. Bigger engines and small guns should give a movement advantage.

## Skill System

Ships can upgrade skill levels for their weapons and engines. This would give a little more granularity for upgrades.

# Minimum Viable Product

We will have reached MVP when we have:

* a single player ship
* a single level comnplete
* five standard enemies
* one boss enemy
** three boss level moves / attack patterns
* a working control system for the player
* a working AI control system for the enemies - this can be on rails

Next steps will require:

* a prototype of several systems
** experience system
** loot system
** ship accessory system
** skill system
* (lots of) models and animations
